<p>For most of my life, I have struggled with mental health challenges, including anxiety and depression.</p>
<br />
<p>These challenges have had profound effects on my life — making it difficult to maintain relationships, keep jobs, and sometimes even manage everyday tasks that many take for granted. I’ve seen friends struggle with the same issues and, tragically, lost some because of it. I know these stories are not unique. So many of us carry them, often in silence.</p>
<br />
<p>Too many people face these battles alone due to the persistent stigma surrounding mental health. Even for those ready to seek help, accessibility is a major hurdle — whether due to cost, lack of resources, or other barriers. As rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide continue to rise, access to support services has only become harder.</p>
<br />
<p>I decided it was time to be part of the solution.</p>
<br />
<p>That’s why I built <a href="https://www.parkbench.ai/" target="_new">https://www.parkbench.ai/.</></p>
<br />
<p>Park Bench is an innovative, AI-powered platform designed to offer a safe, private, and free space for personal reflection and support.</p>
<br />
<p>Whether through text-based chat or revolutionary AI-generated video responses, Park Bench provides a space where you can feel heard and supported, judgment-free.</p>
<br />
<p>If you’re curious, take a look around and give it a try. If you’re interested in generating a video, I’d love for you to reach out to me first — these require my laptop to process and are computationally intensive. You can email me at michael@parkbench.ai.</p>
<br />
<p>Here’s a sample of what the app can do: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZR2ZiDx81I" target="_new">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZR2ZiDx81I</a></p>
<br />
<p>I’d deeply appreciate any feedback, support, or thoughts you might have. Together, we can help create spaces where no one feels alone in their mental health journey.</p>
<br />
<p>Thank you.</p>
